# 3d-ptv-jet-flow

@ronshnapp created a beautiful demo case and the analysis for the NCTRV school http://nctr.eu/index.php/en/ and share it with the world. 



The copy of his Readme.txt

A 3D-PTV experimental data
==========================

the flow is a vertical jet of water, inside a square cross-section glass tank.
the water is seeded with 50um paerticles.
a jet is generated from below using a small pump.
occasionally bubbles rise from the jet nozzle in addition to the seeding particles

images taken with 4 cameras, using 60mm Nikon lens, set to f-number8.
the exposure time is set to 6.6 milliseconds
the tank is illuminated from two sides of the jet using two LEDs.


Flowtracks Scenes, calculated with PyPTV, are found in the data folders.
Animations, pictures of the setup, and visualization of the results are 
in the /Videos folder.
raw data (both blobs and images) are in the data folder.  


Sequence1:
==========
100 frames at lower pump speed (15 Volts).
images are taken a rate of 75 images per second.


Sequence2:
==========
100 frames at higher pump speed (19 Volts).
images are taken a rate of 75 images per second.


Sequence3:
==========
100 frames at medium pump speed (18 Volts).
images are taken a rate of 150 images per second.

Sequence4:
==========
100 frames at medium pump speed (18 Volts).
images are taken a rate of 100 images per second.

Sequence5:
==========
7500 blobFrames at medium pump speed (18 Volts).
Blobs are recorded at 150 frames per second. 
(after analysis - flow is VERY slow. not sure what happend)

------------ Next day experiment ------------------

Sequence6:
==========
100 images at high pump speed (20 Volts).
Blobs are recorded at 100 frames per second.

Sequence7:
==========
100 images at high pump speed (20 Volts).
Blobs are recorded at 150 frames per second.

Sequence8:
==========
20 seconds of blobFrames at high pump speed (20 Volts).
Blobs are recorded at 150 frames per second.

Sequence9:
==========
10 seconds of blobFrames at high pump speed (20 Volts).
Blobs are recorded at 100 frames per second.


Sequence10:
==========
13 seconds of blobFrames at high pump speed (20 Volts).
Blobs are recorded at 200 frames per second.
